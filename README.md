# Sales Insights Dashboard (Power BI)

This repo contains a sample retail sales dataset and a Power BI dashboard file (pbix) placeholder.
- Dataset: `sales.csv`
- Screenshot preview: `images_dashboard_preview.png`

**How to use:**
1. Download `sales.csv` and open in Power BI Desktop.
2. Use Power Query to load and transform the data (date parsing, product/region lookups).
3. Build visuals: KPI cards, time series revenue chart, product & region breakdowns, top customers.
4. Save the `.pbix` file in the `dashboard` folder (not included here due to binary content size).
